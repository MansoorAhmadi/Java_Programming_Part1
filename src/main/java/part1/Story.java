// or your display is otherwise very narrow, try to stretch the display horizontally to see if the text aligns differently.
// The exercise expects the text to align as it does on wider displays.

//Write a program that asks the user for a character's name and their job. The program then prints a short story.
//
//The output must be as shown below â€” note, the name and job depend on the user's input.
